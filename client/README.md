## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

The original idea was to create a album/artist generater with given parameters of year, genre, and mood. I thought I had the right api but unfortunately I was not able to access it. Although I wasn't able to create the original idea. I thought soon after that starting my journey in SE on a smaller scale would be more beneficial. With this pivot in goals I was able to access two Api's while using the result of one to satify the arugment of another.
